<h2>Description</h2>
<p>A Cornish game hen is a variety of broiler chicken, which are chickens raised specifically for meat production. The result of cross-breeding Cornish and White Plymouth Rock chickens, Cornish game hens are served young and usually weigh between one and two pounds.</p>

<p>Their small size gives the hens a unique flavor and texture that's different from regular chicken. Cornish game hens are usually enjoyed individually as single-serving entrees.</p>
