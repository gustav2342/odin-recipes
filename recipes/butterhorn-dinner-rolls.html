<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Hook 'em Horns!</p>
<p>You might have grown up calling these crescent rolls, since that's what was
    printed on the side of the cardboard tube from the store, but I think
    butterhorns is way cooler of a name. The only real difference, besides the
    fact that these are so much better, is that crescent rolls are shaped into a
    crescent versus the usually straighter design of your average butterhorn.
    Basically, all crescent rolls are butterhorns, but not all butterhorns are
    crescent rolls.

    This is a very simple recipe, although I did alter the kneading procedure here
    to make things maybe a bit easier for the novice baker. Doughs that have rested
    and risen are always way easier to work with, so we let this one rise first
    before kneading. It seemed to work out just fine, as long as you allow the dough
    to rise again before portioning and shaping. Give it a try, and see for
    yourself. Otherwise just use the classic knead-first method. Either way, I
    really do hope you give these a try soon. Enjoy!

<h2>ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast</li>
    <li>¼ cup warm water</li>
    <li>½ cup unsalted butter</li>
    <li>1 cup milk</li>
    <li>3 tablespoons white sugar</li>
    <li>3 ¾ cups all-purpose flour, divided</li>
    <li>1 ½ teaspoons kosher salt</li>
    <li>1 large egg yolk</li>
    <li>¼ cup butter, melted</li>
</ul>


<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Sprinkle yeast onto warm water. Stir gently and let sit until foamy and frothy, 15 to 20 minutes.</li>
    <li>While the yeast is proofing, place butter in a saucepan with milk and white sugar. Turn heat to medium and cook, stirring occasionally, until butter melts and sugar dissolves, 3 to 4 minutes.</li>
    <li>Remove from the heat and pour into a large mixing bowl; let cool until just very warm to the touch and about 120 degrees F (49 degrees C), 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
    <li>Add 3 cups flour, kosher salt, yeast mixture, and egg; mix gently with a spatula until it all comes together and forms a very thick and wet batter. Add remaining 3/4 cup flour and mix with your fingers, incorporating just the amount of flour you need, until dough comes together into a soft, sticky ball.</li>
    <li>Cover and let rise until almost doubled in size, about 1 hour.</li>
    <li>Transfer dough to a floured surface and knead until smooth and elastic, about 5 minutes.</li>
    <li>Grease the bowl with butter. Place the dough back into the bowl, cover, and let rise for 30 minutes.</li>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with a silicone liner (such as Silpat®).</li>
    <li>Transfer dough back to a work surface and press it into a 1-inch thick circle. Flip over and continue pressing until circle is 1/2-inch thick; use a rolling pin if needed to achieve correct thickness. Use a pizza tool to cut dough into 12 equal wedges.</li>
    <li>Starting at the larger end of one wedge, roll toward the point, stretching the ends of the dough out for the first few inches. Pinch and press the point into the dough to seal and place, seam-side down, on the prepared baking sheet. Repeat with remaining dough.</li>
    <li>Let rolls sit until they puff up a little, 15 to 20 minutes.</li>
    <li>Bake in the center of the preheated oven until cooked through and just starting to turn a light golden brown, 20 to 25 minutes.</li>
    <li>Remove from the oven and immediately brush hot rolls with melted butter. Transfer to a wire rack to cool completely, 15 to 20 minutes.</li>
