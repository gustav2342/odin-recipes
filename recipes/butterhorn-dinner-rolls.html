<p>You might have grown up calling these crescent rolls, since that's what was
    printed on the side of the cardboard tube from the store, but I think
    butterhorns is way cooler of a name. The only real difference, besides the
    fact that these are so much better, is that crescent rolls are shaped into a
    crescent versus the usually straighter design of your average butterhorn.
    Basically, all crescent rolls are butterhorns, but not all butterhorns are
    crescent rolls.

    This is a very simple recipe, although I did alter the kneading procedure here
    to make things maybe a bit easier for the novice baker. Doughs that have rested
    and risen are always way easier to work with, so we let this one rise first
    before kneading. It seemed to work out just fine, as long as you allow the dough
    to rise again before portioning and shaping. Give it a try, and see for
    yourself. Otherwise just use the classic knead-first method. Either way, I
    really do hope you give these a try soon. Enjoy!
